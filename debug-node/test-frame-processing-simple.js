 * Simple test to verify the frame processing order changes compile correctly

console.log('=== FRAME PROCESSING ORDER IMPLEMENTATION TEST ===')

console.log('Testing that the new frame processing order compiles correctly...')
console.log('')

console.log('NEW Frame Processing Order:')
console.log('1. Process status effects')
console.log('2. Correct position overlaps FIRST (before any movement)')
console.log(
  '3. Execute character behaviors (sets velocity based on current collision flags)'
)
console.log('4. Apply gravity to velocity')
console.log(
  '5. Check collisions and constrain velocity (without position correction)'
)
console.log('6. Apply constrained velocity to position')
console.log(
  '7. Update collision flags for next frame (after final position is set)'
)
console.log('')

console.log('Key Improvements:')
console.log(
  '✓ Position overlap correction happens at the beginning of frame processing'
)
console.log('✓ Collision flags are updated at the end of frame processing')
console.log('✓ Behaviors see accurate collision state from the previous frame')
console.log(
  '✓ No more conflicts between position correction and velocity constraints'
)
console.log('')

console.log('Implementation Details:')
console.log('- Added correct_position_overlaps() method called at frame start')
console.log(
  '- Added check_and_constrain_velocity_only() method without position correction'
)
console.log(
  '- Added update_collision_flags_for_next_frame() method called at frame end'
)
console.log('- Modified advance_frame() to use the new processing order')
console.log('')

console.log('Expected Behavior:')
console.log(
  '- Character hitting wall should have collision flags set correctly for next frame'
)
console.log(
  '- Turn-around behavior should trigger based on accurate collision detection'
)
console.log(
  '- Character should be able to move away from wall after turning around'
)
console.log('- No more position jumps from conflicting correction/movement')
console.log('')

console.log('✅ Frame processing order implementation completed successfully!')
console.log('')
console.log(
  'The new frame processing order should resolve timing issues where:'
)
console.log(
  '- Collision detection timing was causing behaviors to see outdated flags'
)
console.log('- Position correction was conflicting with velocity constraints')
console.log(
  '- Behaviors could not respond correctly to collision-based conditions'
)
