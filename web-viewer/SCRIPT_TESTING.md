# Script Integration Testing Guide

This document explains how to test the script constants with WASM integration in the Robot Masters Web Viewer.

## Overview

Task 4 has been completed with comprehensive script integration testing that validates:

- ‚úÖ ACTION_SCRIPTS work correctly with WASM game engine
- ‚úÖ CONDITION_SCRIPTS trigger properly in game scenarios
- ‚úÖ Script template mixing functionality
- ‚úÖ All action types: run, turn around, jump, wall jump, and charge
- ‚úÖ All condition types: always, chance-based, energy-based, and collision-based
- ‚úÖ Proper energy consumption and timing mechanics
- ‚úÖ Debugging output for script execution validation

## Files Created

### Core Implementation

- `src/tests/scriptIntegrationTest.ts` - Main test suite with comprehensive validation
- `src/tests/testConfigurations.ts` - Pre-built test configurations for each script type
- `src/tests/testRunner.ts` - Quick test runner for browser console usage
- `validate-scripts.js` - Node.js validation script to verify implementation
- `test-integration.js` - Browser integration test utilities

### Enhanced Components

- `src/components/DebugPanel.tsx` - Enhanced with script testing tab and controls

## How to Test

### 1. Validation (Pre-Testing)

First, validate that all script integration components are properly implemented:

```bash
cd web-viewer
node validate-scripts.js
```

This will verify:

- Script constants are properly defined
- Test configurations are available
- Integration test suite is complete

### 2. Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Browser Console Testing

Open the browser console and use these commands:

#### Quick Tests

```javascript
// Test all script integrations
await runComprehensiveTests()

// Test specific configuration
await testConfig('RUN_ALWAYS')
await testConfig('JUMP_GROUNDED')
await testConfig('MIXED_SCRIPTS')
```

#### Available Test Configurations

- `RUN_ALWAYS` - Character continuously moves right
- `TURN_AROUND` - Character randomly changes direction
- `JUMP_GROUNDED` - Character jumps when touching ground
- `WALL_JUMP` - Character wall jumps when sliding against walls
- `CHARGE_LOW_ENERGY` - Character charges when energy is low
- `MIXED_SCRIPTS` - Multiple scripts working together
- `ENERGY_CONSUMPTION` - High energy cost actions to test consumption
- `CHANCE_CONDITIONS` - Multiple characters with different chance conditions
- `COLLISION_CONDITIONS` - Tests collision-based script triggers

#### Advanced Testing

```javascript
// Access full test suite
const testSuite = window.scriptIntegrationTests
await testSuite.initialize()
const results = await testSuite.runAllTests()
testSuite.printResults()

// Access quick test runner
const runner = window.scriptTestRunner
await runner.validateAllActions()
await runner.validateAllConditions()
```

### 4. Debug Panel Testing

The enhanced Debug Panel includes a "Scripts" tab with:

- **Run All Script Tests** - Executes comprehensive test suite
- **Load Test Config** buttons - Quick load pre-built test configurations
- **Test Results** display - Shows pass/fail status for each test
- **Script Validation** - Step through frames and analyze character behavior

## Test Coverage

### Action Scripts Tested

1. **RUN** - Moves character based on facing direction and move speed

   - ‚úÖ Velocity changes correctly
   - ‚úÖ Direction affects movement
   - ‚úÖ No energy consumption for basic movement

2. **TURN_AROUND** - Flips character facing direction

   - ‚úÖ Facing direction changes from left to right or vice versa
   - ‚úÖ No energy consumption
   - ‚úÖ Works with chance-based conditions

3. **JUMP** - Applies upward velocity with energy cost

   - ‚úÖ Negative Y velocity (upward movement)
   - ‚úÖ Energy consumption validation
   - ‚úÖ Energy requirement checking

4. **WALL_JUMP** - Jumps off walls with horizontal and vertical force

   - ‚úÖ Wall collision detection
   - ‚úÖ Combined horizontal and vertical movement
   - ‚úÖ Higher energy cost validation

5. **CHARGE** - Recovers energy over time
   - ‚úÖ Energy increases when below cap
   - ‚úÖ Timing mechanics with charge rate
   - ‚úÖ Energy cap enforcement

### Condition Scripts Tested

1. **ALWAYS** - Always triggers (100% chance)

   - ‚úÖ Consistent script execution
   - ‚úÖ Continuous character behavior

2. **CHANCE_10/20/50** - Random percentage triggers

   - ‚úÖ Random number generation
   - ‚úÖ Threshold-based triggering
   - ‚úÖ Variable behavior patterns

3. **ENERGY_LOW_10/20** - Triggers when energy below threshold

   - ‚úÖ Energy percentage calculations
   - ‚úÖ Threshold comparison logic
   - ‚úÖ Energy-based behavior switching

4. **IS_GROUNDED** - Triggers when touching ground

   - ‚úÖ Bottom collision detection
   - ‚úÖ Ground-based behavior activation

5. **IS_WALL_SLIDING** - Triggers when sliding against walls
   - ‚úÖ Wall collision detection (left/right)
   - ‚úÖ Not grounded condition
   - ‚úÖ Combined collision logic

### Integration Features Tested

1. **Script Template Mixing**

   - ‚úÖ Multiple scripts per character
   - ‚úÖ Different action/condition combinations
   - ‚úÖ Script priority and execution order

2. **Energy Consumption Mechanics**

   - ‚úÖ Energy cost application
   - ‚úÖ Energy requirement validation
   - ‚úÖ Energy regeneration timing

3. **WASM Integration**
   - ‚úÖ Configuration loading and validation
   - ‚úÖ Game state updates and retrieval
   - ‚úÖ Frame stepping and timing
   - ‚úÖ Error handling and debugging

## Debugging Output

The test suite provides comprehensive debugging output:

### Console Logging

- Frame-by-frame execution details
- Character state changes (position, energy, facing, velocity)
- Script execution validation
- Error reporting with context

### Debug Panel Integration

- Real-time game state display
- Script execution validation
- Test result visualization

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WASM not initialized**

   - Ensure the web viewer has fully loaded
   - Check browser console for WASM loading errors

2. **Configuration load failures**

   - Verify script constants are properly formatted
   - Check for syntax errors in test configurations

3. **Test execution failures**
   - Ensure game is properly initialized before testing
   - Check for frame stepping errors in console

### Debug Commands

```javascript
// Check WASM status
window.robotMastersDebug.getHealthInfo()

// Dump current game state
window.robotMastersDebug.dumpState()

// Enable verbose logging
window.robotMastersDebug.enableVerboseLogging()
```
