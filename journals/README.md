# Development Journals

This directory contains organized documentation of development progress, investigations, and findings.

## Directory Structure

### `/task-successes/`

Documentation of successfully completed major tasks and milestones.

- `TASK_17_SUCCESS.md` - Turn-around behavior velocity bug resolution

### `/bug-fixes/`

Detailed documentation of bugs discovered and their resolutions.

- `BOUNCING_BUG_FIXED.md` - Character bouncing behavior fix
- `COLLISION_OPTIMIZATION_FINAL.md` - Final collision system optimization
- `COLLISION_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Collision optimization process summary
- `direction-indicator-fix-summary.md` - Direction indicator bug fix
- `json-serialization-fix-summary.md` - JSON serialization issues resolution

### `/investigations/`

Analysis and investigation documents for complex system behaviors.

- `COLLISION_DETECTION_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive collision detection analysis
- `COLLISION_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md` - Collision system investigation summary
- `DIRECTION_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Direction system behavior documentation
- `PROPERTY_ADDRESS_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Property system reorganization
- `cleanup-summary.md` - Code cleanup and organization summary
- `frame-processing-order-summary.md` - Frame processing pipeline analysis

### `/research/`

Research documents and external technology investigations.

- `box2d-research.md` - Box2D physics engine research

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Add Documents

1. **Task Successes**: When completing major features or resolving critical bugs
2. **Bug Fixes**: When fixing any non-trivial bug that required investigation
3. **Investigations**: When analyzing complex system behaviors or debugging issues
4. **Research**: When investigating external technologies or design patterns

### Document Naming Convention

- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- Include the type of document in the name when helpful
- Date-stamp documents when chronological order matters
- Reference related task numbers when applicable

### Content Guidelines

- Include problem description, investigation process, and solution
- Document root causes and prevention strategies
- Add code examples and test results when relevant
- Reference related files and tasks
- Explain the impact and broader implications

## Integration with Development Process

These journals serve as:

- **Historical record** of development decisions and their outcomes
- **Knowledge base** for preventing repeated issues
- **Reference material** for understanding complex system behaviors
- **Documentation** of successful patterns and anti-patterns
- **Context** for future developers working on the codebase

## Maintenance

- Review and update documents when systems change significantly
- Archive outdated documents to maintain relevance
- Cross-reference related documents for better navigation
- Update the main development principles based on learnings
