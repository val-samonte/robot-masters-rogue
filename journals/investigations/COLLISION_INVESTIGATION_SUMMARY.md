# Collision Detection Investigation Summary

## Task 11 Analysis Complete ✅

This document summarizes the completed investigation of collision detection issues as specified in Task 11.

## Investigation Requirements Met

### ✅ Document exact frame execution order in `game-engine/src/state.rs::advance_frame()`

**Frame Processing Order Documented:**

1. Process status effects
2. Execute character behaviors (sets velocity)
3. Apply gravity to velocity
4. **Check collisions and constrain velocity** (`check_and_constrain_movement`)
   - Calls `correct_entity_overlap_static()` - **POSITION CORRECTION HAPPENS HERE**
   - Checks horizontal/vertical movement constraints
   - Updates collision flags
5. Apply velocity to position
6. Clean up entities

### ✅ Trace character position changes through each frame processing step

**Position Jump Traced:**

- **Frame 0**: Character at x=230.0, velocity (0.0, 0.0)
- **Frame 1**: Character at x=256.0, velocity (0.0, 0.5)
- **Position Change**: 26-pixel jump during step 4 (collision checking)
- **Root Cause**: `correct_entity_overlap_static()` method

### ✅ Identify where the x=230 → x=256 jump occurs

**Jump Location Identified:**

- **Method**: `correct_entity_overlap_static()` in `game-engine/src/state.rs`
- **When**: During step 4 of frame processing (collision detection vs position correction)
- **Why**: Algorithm tries pushing left first with MAX_CORRECTION_DISTANCE = 32 pixels

### ✅ Document current tilemap coordinate system

**Coordinate System Documented:**

- **Tilemap**: 16x15 tiles, 16 pixels per tile
- **Game Area**: 256 pixels wide × 240 pixels tall
- **Tile Boundaries**: tile_x _ 16, tile_y _ 16
- **Wall Positions**: Left wall at x=0, Right wall at x=240 (column 15 × 16)

### ✅ Verify tilemap wall positions

**Wall Positions Verified:**

- Left wall: x=0 (column 0 × 16 = 0) ✅
- Right wall: x=240 (column 15 × 16 = 240) ✅
- Character at x=230 with width=16 has right edge at x=246
- Right edge overlaps wall at x=240 by 6 pixels ✅

### ✅ Debug Tools Setup

**Debug Tools Created:**

1. **`debug-node/debug-collision-simple.js`** ✅

   - Works correctly
   - Shows position jump and wrong collision flags
   - Minimal test case with character near wall boundary

2. **`debug-node/debug-collision-detailed.js`** ✅

   - Frame-by-frame position tracking
   - Traces each frame processing step
   - Identifies exact timing of position jump

3. **`debug-node/debug-position-correction.js`** ✅
   - Isolated position correction testing
   - Tests multiple overlap scenarios
   - Confirms algorithm issues

### ✅ Add position tracking through each frame processing step

**Position Tracking Implemented:**

- Before/after frame analysis
- Position delta calculations
- Velocity change tracking
- Collision flag state monitoring

### ✅ Create minimal test case with character near wall boundary

**Minimal Test Case Created:**

- Character starts at x=230 (6 pixels from wall collision)
- No behaviors (to isolate position correction)
- Clear expected vs actual behavior documentation

## Expected Outcome Achieved ✅

**Clear documentation of where and why position jumps occur:**

### Where:

`correct_entity_overlap_static()` method in `game-engine/src/state.rs` during step 4 of frame processing

### Why:

1. **MAX_CORRECTION_DISTANCE = 32** is too large (2 tiles worth of movement)
2. **Always tries left first** regardless of movement direction or overlap location
3. **No boundary checking** allows pushing entities outside game area
4. **Linear search algorithm** tries every pixel from 1 to 32

### Impact:

- Character jumps 26 pixels in wrong direction (x=230 → x=256)
- Character ends up outside game boundaries (x=256 > 240)
- Wrong collision flags set (left instead of right)
- Physics system becomes non-deterministic

## Foundation for Fixing Collision Detection System ✅

This analysis provides the foundation for fixing the collision detection system by:

1. **Identifying root cause**: Broken position correction algorithm
2. **Documenting exact issues**: Position jumps, wrong flags, boundary violations
3. **Creating debug tools**: Comprehensive testing capabilities
4. **Establishing coordinate system**: Clear tilemap and entity boundaries
5. **Tracing frame processing**: Understanding timing and order issues

The investigation is complete and provides all necessary information for implementing the fixes in subsequent tasks (11.1 through 11.6).
