# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The game engine has undergone significant development since the initial documentation was created. Multiple critical bugs have been fixed, new features have been implemented, and the current steering documents contain outdated information that could mislead future development. The documentation needs to be comprehensively updated to reflect the current state of the engine, including completed fixes, current implementation status, and remaining issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the game engine, I want accurate documentation of the current property implementation status, so that I know which properties are available and which still need implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing property documentation THEN it SHALL accurately reflect which properties are implemented in both ConditionContext and ActionContext
2. WHEN checking collision properties THEN the documentation SHALL reflect that CHARACTER*COLLISION*\* properties are fully implemented and working
3. WHEN reviewing energy properties THEN the documentation SHALL reflect that energy regeneration with cap enforcement is implemented and working
4. WHEN checking direction properties THEN the documentation SHALL reflect that ENTITY*DIR*\* properties are implemented with correct Fixed-point conversion
5. WHEN reviewing missing properties THEN the documentation SHALL provide an accurate list of unimplemented properties with their expected behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on behavior systems, I want accurate documentation of fixed bugs and current system status, so that I don't waste time debugging already-resolved issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing collision system documentation THEN it SHALL reflect that the wall collision priority system bug has been fixed
2. WHEN checking turn-around behavior documentation THEN it SHALL reflect that the velocity bug has been resolved and characters can move away from walls
3. WHEN reviewing condition instance management THEN it SHALL reflect that the ONLY_ONCE condition state persistence bug has been fixed
4. WHEN checking energy regeneration THEN it SHALL reflect that the energy cap overflow bug has been resolved
5. WHEN reviewing gravity direction system THEN it SHALL reflect the current corrected implementation status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer implementing script constants, I want accurate documentation of EXIT operator compliance issues, so that I can implement scripts correctly and avoid execution flow bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing EXIT operators THEN the documentation SHALL clearly specify the exit_flag parameter requirements for all EXIT operators
2. WHEN using EXIT_IF_NO_ENERGY THEN the documentation SHALL specify that energy requirements come from context, not script parameters
3. WHEN implementing multi-behavior configurations THEN the documentation SHALL explain how exit_flag values affect behavior sequencing
4. WHEN reviewing script constants THEN the documentation SHALL identify which current implementations violate EXIT operator compliance
5. WHEN fixing EXIT operator issues THEN the documentation SHALL provide correct implementation patterns and examples

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on the codebase, I want updated development journals that reflect recent successes and current system state, so that I can understand the evolution of the system and learn from past solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing task successes THEN the journals SHALL include comprehensive documentation of major bug fixes like Task 17 (turn-around behavior) and Task 23 (condition instance management)
2. WHEN checking bug fix documentation THEN it SHALL include root cause analysis, solution implementation, and impact assessment for each major fix
3. WHEN reviewing system investigations THEN the journals SHALL document the collision system analysis and frame processing pipeline improvements
4. WHEN checking current issues THEN the documentation SHALL accurately reflect which issues are resolved and which remain open
5. WHEN reviewing prevention strategies THEN the documentation SHALL include lessons learned from major bug fixes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on the game engine, I want accurate architectural documentation that reflects the current implementation, so that I can understand the system design and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the main game engine design document THEN it SHALL accurately reflect the current entity system with proper EntityCore structure
2. WHEN checking script execution documentation THEN it SHALL reflect the current ScriptEngine implementation with proper context handling
3. WHEN reviewing property access patterns THEN the documentation SHALL reflect the current property address constants and implementation patterns
4. WHEN checking error handling documentation THEN it SHALL reflect the current ErrorRecovery system and validation approaches
5. WHEN reviewing frame processing pipeline THEN the documentation SHALL accurately describe the current processing order and collision handling
