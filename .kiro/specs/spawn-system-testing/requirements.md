# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The spawn system has been implemented in the game engine but needs comprehensive testing in the web viewer to ensure it works correctly in the actual user interface. This includes verifying spawn creation, rendering, physics, collision detection, and cleanup functionality through the complete web viewer pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that spawns are created correctly in the web viewer, so that I can confirm the spawn system integration works end-to-end.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a spawn creation action is triggered THEN the spawn SHALL appear visually in the web viewer
2. WHEN spawns are created THEN they SHALL have the correct initial properties (position, size, sprite, etc.)
3. WHEN multiple spawns are created THEN each spawn SHALL be rendered independently without conflicts
4. WHEN spawns are created THEN the game state JSON SHALL reflect the new spawn entities correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify spawn physics and movement work correctly in the web viewer, so that spawns behave as expected in the visual environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spawns are created with velocity THEN they SHALL move visually in the web viewer
2. WHEN spawns are affected by gravity THEN they SHALL fall appropriately in the visual display
3. WHEN spawns reach terminal velocity THEN their movement SHALL be constrained correctly
4. WHEN spawns move THEN their position updates SHALL be smooth and consistent in the renderer

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify spawn collision detection works in the web viewer, so that spawns interact properly with the environment and other entities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spawns collide with tilemap walls THEN they SHALL stop moving and show collision response
2. WHEN spawns collide with characters THEN appropriate collision flags SHALL be set for both entities
3. WHEN spawns fall and hit the ground THEN they SHALL stop falling and rest on the surface
4. WHEN spawns are in collision states THEN the visual representation SHALL accurately reflect their collision status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify spawn lifecycle management works in the web viewer, so that spawns are properly created, updated, and cleaned up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spawns exceed their lifespan THEN they SHALL be removed from the visual display
2. WHEN spawns are destroyed by actions THEN they SHALL disappear from the web viewer immediately
3. WHEN the game state is reset THEN all spawns SHALL be cleared from the visual display
4. WHEN spawns are removed THEN there SHALL be no visual artifacts or memory leaks in the renderer

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test different spawn configurations in the web viewer, so that I can verify the system handles various spawn types and properties correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spawns are created with different sprites THEN each spawn type SHALL render with the correct visual appearance
2. WHEN spawns are created with different sizes THEN they SHALL display at the correct scale in the web viewer
3. WHEN spawns are created with different physics properties THEN their behavior SHALL match their configuration
4. WHEN spawns are created with different collision properties THEN their interaction behavior SHALL be appropriate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test spawn-character interactions in the web viewer, so that I can verify the complete entity interaction system works visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN characters trigger spawn creation actions THEN spawns SHALL appear at the correct positions relative to the character
2. WHEN characters and spawns are in proximity THEN any proximity-based behaviors SHALL trigger correctly
3. WHEN characters and spawns collide THEN both entities SHALL respond appropriately in the visual display
4. WHEN spawns affect character properties THEN the character's visual state SHALL update accordingly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify spawn system performance in the web viewer, so that the spawn system doesn't negatively impact the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple spawns are active simultaneously THEN the web viewer frame rate SHALL remain stable
2. WHEN spawns are created and destroyed frequently THEN there SHALL be no noticeable performance degradation
3. WHEN the spawn count reaches reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL handle the load without crashes
4. WHEN spawns are active THEN memory usage SHALL remain within acceptable bounds
