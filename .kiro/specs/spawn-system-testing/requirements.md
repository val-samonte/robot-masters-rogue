# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Create a simple bullet shooting system to verify that spawns work correctly in the game. A character should occasionally shoot bullets that travel horizontally and disappear after 3 seconds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want characters to occasionally shoot bullets, so that I can see the spawn system working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the random condition triggers (20% chance) THEN the character SHALL shoot a bullet
2. WHEN a bullet is created THEN it SHALL appear visually in the game
3. WHEN bullets are created THEN they SHALL spawn at the character's position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want bullets to move horizontally, so that they behave like projectiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bullet is created THEN it SHALL move horizontally in the character's facing direction
2. WHEN bullets move THEN they SHALL maintain consistent horizontal velocity
3. WHEN bullets reach walls THEN they SHALL continue moving (simple implementation)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want bullets to disappear after 3 seconds, so that they don't clutter the screen forever.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bullet has existed for 3 seconds THEN it SHALL disappear from the game
2. WHEN bullets disappear THEN they SHALL be removed cleanly without visual artifacts
3. WHEN bullets are removed THEN the game performance SHALL remain stable
