  - Add test for manual spawn destruction through character actions
  - Create cleanup validation to ensure no spawn artifacts remain
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Create multiple spawn configuration test

  - Design test scenario with multiple different spawn types
  - Implement validation for different spawn sprites and visual properties
  - Add test for spawns with different sizes and collision properties
  - Create performance monitoring for multiple active spawns
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Implement spawn-character interaction test

  - Create test scenario where character actions create spawns at specific positions
  - Implement validation for spawn positioning relative to character
  - Add test for proximity-based behaviors between spawns and characters
  - Create interaction state validation to check mutual effects
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 9. Create performance monitoring system

  - Implement frame rate monitoring during spawn tests
  - Add memory usage tracking for spawn creation and destruction
  - Create performance benchmarks for different spawn counts
  - Implement performance regression detection between test runs
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 10. Build comprehensive test suite runner

  - Create test runner that executes all spawn test configurations sequentially
  - Implement test result aggregation and reporting system
  - Add test failure isolation to prevent one failed test from stopping others
  - Create comprehensive test report generation with pass/fail status
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 11. Create visual debugging tools

  - Implement debug overlay system for spawn inspection
  - Add spawn property display panel showing real-time spawn data
  - Create spawn bounds and collision box visualization
  - Implement spawn trail visualization to show movement history
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.4, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 12. Implement edge case and stress testing

  - Create test configurations for boundary conditions (spawns at map edges)
  - Implement high spawn count stress test (50+ simultaneous spawns)
  - Add rapid spawn creation/destruction test for memory leak detection
  - Create invalid parameter handling test for spawn creation robustness
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [ ] 13. Create test documentation and usage guide

  - Write documentation for running spawn system tests
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common test failures
  - Document expected visual behaviors for manual verification
  - Create test result interpretation guide for developers
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 14. Integrate with existing web viewer debug tools

  - Connect spawn tests with existing console logging system
  - Integrate spawn validation with current game state inspection tools
  - Add spawn test controls to existing debug UI panels
