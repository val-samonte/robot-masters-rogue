# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The web viewer is a browser-based application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript that provides a visual interface for viewing and interacting with Robot Masters game simulations. It will consume the WASM wrapper to display real-time game state, allow configuration loading, and provide controls for game execution. The viewer uses Tailwind 4 for styling, Jotai for state management, and React PIXI/PIXI.js for rendering entities based on their position and size. The viewer serves as both a development tool for testing game configurations and a demonstration platform for showcasing the game engine capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want predefined script templates for common actions and conditions, so that I can easily create and test different character behaviors without writing scripts from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating action scripts THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript templates for: run, turn around, jump, wall jump, and charge actions
2. WHEN creating condition scripts THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript templates for: always, 10% chance, 20% chance, 50% chance, energy < 10%, energy < 20%, is grounded, and is wall sliding conditions
3. WHEN using script templates THEN the system SHALL generate proper bytecode using operator_address constants
4. WHEN swapping between templates THEN the system SHALL allow easy substitution of actions and conditions in game configurations
5. WHEN testing behaviors THEN the system SHALL validate that all template scripts execute correctly in the game engine

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load game configurations into the web viewer, so that I can test and visualize different game scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a JSON configuration file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the configuration
2. WHEN a valid configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL initialize the game state using the WASM wrapper
3. WHEN an invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with validation details
4. WHEN a configuration is successfully loaded THEN the system SHALL display the initial game state visually

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a real-time visual representation of the game state, so that I can understand character positions, movements, and interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game state updates THEN the system SHALL render entities using PIXI.js based on their position and size properties
2. WHEN characters move THEN the system SHALL update their display positions to reflect the current game state
3. WHEN spawns are created THEN the system SHALL display them as visual entities positioned according to their coordinates
4. WHEN status effects are active THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators on affected characters
5. WHEN the tilemap is rendered THEN the system SHALL display the grid-based game world as the background

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to inspect detailed game state information, so that I can debug configurations and understand game mechanics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a character THEN the system SHALL display detailed character properties (health, energy, position, velocity)
2. WHEN a user hovers over spawns THEN the system SHALL show spawn properties and remaining lifespan
3. WHEN status effects are active THEN the system SHALL list all effects with duration and stack information
4. WHEN the user requests frame information THEN the system SHALL display current frame, elapsed time, and game status
5. WHEN errors occur during execution THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information with context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web viewer to be responsive and performant, so that I can use it effectively across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewer is accessed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
2. WHEN rendering game state THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance during continuous playback
3. WHEN handling large game configurations THEN the system SHALL remain responsive and not block the UI
4. WHEN multiple UI updates occur THEN the system SHALL batch updates efficiently to prevent performance degradation
5. WHEN memory usage grows during long sessions THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web viewer to be built with modern web technologies, so that it is maintainable, performant, and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use Vite as the build tool with React and TypeScript
2. WHEN styling the interface THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind 4 for consistent and responsive design
3. WHEN managing application state THEN the system SHALL use Jotai for atomic state management
4. WHEN rendering game entities THEN the system SHALL use React PIXI/PIXI.js for hardware-accelerated graphics
5. WHEN displaying entities THEN the system SHALL render them based solely on their position and size properties from the game state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control game execution through the web interface, so that I can step through frames, pause, resume, and reset the simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the play button THEN the system SHALL start continuous frame execution at 60 FPS
2. WHEN a user clicks the pause button THEN the system SHALL stop frame execution while maintaining current state
3. WHEN a user clicks the step button THEN the system SHALL advance exactly one frame and update the display
4. WHEN a user clicks the reset button THEN the system SHALL reinitialize the game to frame 0 with the original configuration
5. WHEN the game reaches its maximum frame limit THEN the system SHALL automatically pause execution

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export and share game states and configurations, so that I can save interesting scenarios and collaborate with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests configuration export THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable JSON file with the current configuration
2. WHEN a user requests state export THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable JSON file with the current game state
3. WHEN a user wants to share a scenario THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable URL that includes the configuration
4. WHEN a shared URL is accessed THEN the system SHALL automatically load the embedded configuration
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL ensure all exported files are valid and can be re-imported successfully
