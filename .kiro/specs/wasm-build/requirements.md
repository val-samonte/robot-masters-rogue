# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Robot Masters Game Engine is currently a pure Rust library designed for cross-platform compatibility, including WebAssembly (WASM) targets. To make the engine accessible for web-based applications and provide a practical interface for game development, we need to create a WASM wrapper application that exposes the game engine functionality to JavaScript environments. This wrapper will serve as the primary interface for web-based game clients and provide the foundation for browser-based Robot Masters gameplay.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want a WASM module that exposes the game engine functionality, so that I can integrate Robot Masters gameplay into web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WASM module is built THEN it SHALL compile the game engine to WebAssembly target
2. WHEN the WASM module is built THEN it SHALL expose JavaScript-compatible APIs for game initialization
3. WHEN the WASM module is built THEN it SHALL provide methods for game state management and frame updates
4. WHEN the WASM module is built THEN it SHALL handle memory management between WASM and JavaScript contexts
5. WHEN the WASM module is built THEN it SHALL maintain deterministic behavior identical to native execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want JavaScript bindings for game state access, so that I can read and display game information in web interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript bindings are provided THEN they SHALL expose character positions, health, and status information
2. WHEN JavaScript bindings are provided THEN they SHALL allow access to spawn positions and properties
3. WHEN JavaScript bindings are provided THEN they SHALL provide game frame count and match timing information
4. WHEN JavaScript bindings are provided THEN they SHALL expose tilemap data for rendering systems
5. WHEN JavaScript bindings are provided THEN they SHALL handle data serialization between WASM and JavaScript efficiently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to initialize games with custom data, so that I can create different match scenarios and character configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN game initialization is supported THEN it SHALL accept character definitions through JavaScript objects
2. WHEN game initialization is supported THEN it SHALL allow custom tilemap configuration from JavaScript
3. WHEN game initialization is supported THEN it SHALL support action, condition, spawn, and status effect definitions
4. WHEN game initialization is supported THEN it SHALL validate all input data and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN game initialization is supported THEN it SHALL handle seed configuration for deterministic gameplay

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want efficient frame-by-frame game execution, so that I can create smooth web-based gameplay experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frame execution is implemented THEN it SHALL provide single-frame advancement methods
2. WHEN frame execution is implemented THEN it SHALL maintain 60 FPS timing compatibility
3. WHEN frame execution is implemented THEN it SHALL minimize memory allocations during frame updates
4. WHEN frame execution is implemented THEN it SHALL provide frame timing information for synchronization
5. WHEN frame execution is implemented THEN it SHALL handle JavaScript event loop integration efficiently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want error handling and debugging support, so that I can troubleshoot issues and provide robust web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL provide JavaScript-compatible error objects
2. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL include detailed error messages and context information
3. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL handle WASM memory errors gracefully
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL provide debugging information for script execution failures
5. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL maintain application stability despite game engine errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want build tooling and development workflow, so that I can efficiently develop and deploy WASM-based Robot Masters applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build tooling is provided THEN it SHALL include automated WASM compilation scripts
2. WHEN build tooling is provided THEN it SHALL generate TypeScript definitions for JavaScript bindings
3. WHEN build tooling is provided THEN it SHALL provide development server setup for testing
4. WHEN build tooling is provided THEN it SHALL include optimization settings for production builds
5. WHEN build tooling is provided THEN it SHALL support hot reloading during development
