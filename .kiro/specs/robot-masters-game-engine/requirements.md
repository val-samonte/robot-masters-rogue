# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Robot Masters Game Engine is a specialized no_std Rust library designed to power a Mega Man-inspired arena fighting game that runs both on Solana blockchain and as WebAssembly in browsers. The game operates on a single screen with a 256x240 pixel tilemap (16x16 per tile) and runs at exactly 60 FPS for 64 seconds per match. The engine is deterministic and scriptable, with no direct player inputs - instead, characters are controlled by programmable behaviors defined through bytecode scripts. The engine must handle game logic, state management, and mathematical operations without using floating-point arithmetic to comply with Solana's execution environment restrictions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a frame-based game loop that runs at exactly 60 FPS for 64 seconds, so that matches have consistent timing and can be executed deterministically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loop is called THEN it SHALL advance the game state by exactly one frame
2. WHEN 3840 frames have elapsed THEN the game SHALL end (60 FPS Ã— 64 seconds)
3. WHEN the game loop is exposed THEN it SHALL be callable from both WASM and Solana environments
4. WHEN game state is requested THEN the engine SHALL provide both JSON and serialized byte representations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want fixed-point arithmetic with 5-6 bit precision, so that mathematical calculations are performant, deterministic, and storage-efficient for Solana.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing mathematical operations THEN the engine SHALL use fixed-point arithmetic with 5 or 6 bits of precision
2. WHEN calculating trigonometric functions THEN the engine SHALL use precomputed lookup tables for sin, cos, and atan2
3. WHEN serializing fixed-point numbers THEN they SHALL use minimal storage space
4. WHEN overflow conditions occur THEN the engine SHALL handle them gracefully with defined behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want deterministic seeded randomization, so that game outcomes are reproducible and verifiable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the game THEN it SHALL accept a u16 seed parameter
2. WHEN random values are needed THEN the engine SHALL use the seed for deterministic pseudo-random generation
3. WHEN the game state is serialized THEN the current seed state SHALL be included
4. WHEN the same seed is used THEN identical game sequences SHALL be produced

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a level designer, I want a tilemap system for the game arena, so that I can define the game environment layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the game THEN it SHALL accept a 16x15 byte array representing the tilemap
2. WHEN processing tiles THEN the engine SHALL support empty and block tile types
3. WHEN entities interact with tiles THEN the engine SHALL provide collision detection against the tilemap
4. WHEN the tilemap is accessed THEN it SHALL use the 256x240 pixel resolution with 16x16 pixel tiles

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want programmable Character entities with behavior-driven AI, so that players can create strategic automated fighters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a Character THEN it SHALL have id, group, position, velocity, size, health, energy, and collision properties
2. WHEN processing Character behavior THEN it SHALL execute behaviors from top to bottom until one condition passes
3. WHEN a behavior condition passes THEN it SHALL execute the associated action and restart from behavior index 0
4. WHEN actions require energy THEN behaviors SHALL be skipped if insufficient energy is available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a bytecode scripting system for Conditions and Actions, so that character behaviors can be programmed flexibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating Conditions THEN the engine SHALL execute bytecode scripts to determine if actions are eligible
2. WHEN executing Actions THEN the engine SHALL run bytecode scripts for movement, jumping, shooting, and other behaviors
3. WHEN processing scripts THEN the engine SHALL support the full operator set including arithmetic, conditionals, and game actions
4. WHEN script execution fails THEN the engine SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN scripts are executed THEN they SHALL have access to read-only args array for configuration parameters
6. WHEN scripts need working variables THEN they SHALL use the vars array for temporary storage and calculations
7. WHEN scripts access args THEN the args array SHALL remain read-only throughout script execution
8. WHEN scripts need spawn management THEN they SHALL use the spawns array for spawn ID storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want Status effects that can modify character behavior, so that temporary effects like energy recharging and invulnerability can be implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying Status effects THEN they SHALL have their own bytecode scripts for on_script, tick_script, and off_script
2. WHEN Status effects are active THEN they SHALL execute every frame and can override normal behavior flow
3. WHEN Status effects expire THEN they SHALL be automatically removed and run their off_script
4. WHEN Status effects stack THEN they SHALL respect stack limits and reset behavior as configured

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want Spawn entities for projectiles and other temporary objects, so that complex interactions and attacks can be implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Spawns THEN they SHALL have damage, health, duration, element type, and collision properties
2. WHEN Spawns are active THEN they SHALL execute behavior scripts for movement and interaction
3. WHEN Spawns collide with characters THEN they SHALL execute collision scripts for damage and status effects
4. WHEN Spawns despawn THEN they SHALL execute despawn scripts for effects like explosions
5. WHEN Spawns are created THEN they SHALL carry exactly one element type that defines their damage and effect properties

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want an elemental system with damage types and armor values, so that characters can have strategic strengths and weaknesses against different attack types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining elements THEN the system SHALL support 8 element types: Punct, Blast, Force, Sever, Heat, Cryo, Jolt, and Virus
2. WHEN characters are created THEN they SHALL have armor values (0-255, baseline 100) stored as [u8; 8] for each of the 8 elements
3. WHEN spawns are created THEN they SHALL carry exactly one element type
4. WHEN collision occurs THEN the spawn's element value SHALL be compared against the character's corresponding armor value
5. WHEN characters are initialized THEN their armor values SHALL be set during new_game or loop 0
6. WHEN scripts need armor access THEN property addresses 0x40-0x47 SHALL provide read/write access to character armor values

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a blockchain developer, I want efficient serialization of the complete game state, so that it can be stored in Solana PDAs with minimal cost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serializing game state THEN it SHALL produce compact binary representations of all entities and state
2. WHEN deserializing game state THEN it SHALL validate data integrity and restore exact game state
3. WHEN storing on Solana THEN the serialized state SHALL fit within PDA size constraints
4. IF serialization fails THEN the engine SHALL provide clear error information

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a platform integrator, I want a pure game engine library with no platform-specific dependencies, so that it can be consumed by separate WASM and Solana projects without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compiling the game engine THEN it SHALL contain no WASM-specific dependencies or bindings
2. WHEN used as a library THEN it SHALL expose pure Rust functions that can be called by other projects
3. WHEN integrated into different platforms THEN the engine SHALL maintain identical behavior across all environments
4. WHEN platform-specific bindings are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented in separate wrapper projects that consume this engine
