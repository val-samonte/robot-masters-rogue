# Design Document

## Overview

~~The current game engine embeds Actions, Conditions, Spawns, and StatusEffects directly into Characters and other entities, causing significant memory overhead and data duplication.~~ This design ~~refactors~~ **has refactored** the system to use a definition-based architecture where these components are defined once and referenced by ID, similar to how SpawnDefinitions ~~are currently~~ **were previously** handled.

The refactoring ~~will introduce~~ **has introduced** definition collections at the game state level and ~~modify~~ **modified** Characters to store behavior as (ConditionId, ActionId) pairs instead of embedded objects. This approach ~~reduces~~ **has reduced** memory usage, ~~improves~~ **improved** serialization efficiency, and ~~enables~~ **enabled** better reusability of game logic components.

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - All design goals have been achieved and the system is fully operational.

## Architecture

### ~~Current~~ **Previous** Architecture Issues ✅ RESOLVED

- ~~Characters embed full Condition and Action objects in their behaviors Vec~~ **→ Now use (ConditionId, ActionId) pairs**
- ~~Multiple characters using the same behavior duplicate the entire script data~~ **→ Now reference shared definitions**
- ~~Game state serialization includes redundant script bytecode~~ **→ Now serializes definitions once**
- ~~Memory usage scales poorly with the number of characters and behaviors~~ **→ Now scales with unique definitions**

### ~~New~~ **Implemented** Architecture Benefits ✅ ACHIEVED

- ✅ Single source of truth for all definitions
- ✅ Memory usage scales with unique definitions, not usage count
- ✅ Improved serialization efficiency
- ✅ Better separation of concerns between definitions and instances
- ✅ Consistent pattern with existing SpawnDefinition system

## Components and Interfaces

### Definition Collections

The GameState will be extended with new definition collections:

```rust
pub struct GameState {
    // Existing fields...
    pub action_definitions: Vec<ActionDefinition>,
    pub condition_definitions: Vec<ConditionDefinition>,
    pub spawn_definitions: Vec<SpawnDefinition>, // Already exists
    pub status_effect_definitions: Vec<StatusEffectDefinition>,

    // Instance collections for active game objects
    pub action_instances: Vec<ActionInstance>,
    pub condition_instances: Vec<ConditionInstance>,
    pub status_effect_instances: Vec<StatusEffectInstance>, // Already exists on characters
}
```

### Definition Structures

Each definition type contains the static configuration data (vars and fixed arrays have been moved to instances):

```rust
pub struct ActionDefinition {
    pub energy_cost: u8,
    pub interval: u16,
    pub duration: u16,
    pub cooldown: u16,
    pub args: [u8; 8],        // Static configuration only
    pub spawns: [u8; 4],      // References to spawn definitions
    pub script: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct ConditionDefinition {
    pub energy_mul: Fixed,
    pub args: [u8; 8],        // Static configuration only
    pub script: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct StatusEffectDefinition {
    pub duration: u16,
    pub stack_limit: u8,
    pub reset_on_stack: bool,
    pub args: [u8; 8],        // Static configuration only
    pub spawns: [u8; 4],      // References to spawn definitions
    pub on_script: Vec<u8>,
    pub tick_script: Vec<u8>,
    pub off_script: Vec<u8>,
}
```

### Instance Structures

Instances will contain runtime state and reference their definitions:

```rust
pub struct ActionInstance {
    pub definition_id: ActionId,
    pub remaining_duration: u16,
    pub last_used_frame: u16,
    pub runtime_vars: [u8; 8],
    pub runtime_fixed: [Fixed; 4],
}

pub struct ConditionInstance {
    pub definition_id: ConditionId,
    pub runtime_vars: [u8; 8],
    pub runtime_fixed: [Fixed; 4],
}
```

### Character Behavior Modification

Characters now store behaviors as ID pairs and status effects as ID references:

```rust
pub struct Character {
    // Existing fields...
    pub behaviors: Vec<(ConditionId, ActionId)>, // ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Changed from embedded objects
    pub locked_action: Option<ActionInstanceId>, // ✅ IMPLEMENTED - References instance, not definition
    pub status_effects: Vec<StatusEffectInstanceId>, // ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Changed from embedded objects
    pub action_last_used: Vec<u16>, // ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Tracks cooldowns per action definition
    // Other fields remain the same...
}
```

### Public API Changes

✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - The new_game function now accepts definition collections with validation:

```rust
pub fn new_game(
    seed: u16,
    tilemap: [[u8; 16]; 15],
    characters: Vec<Character>,
    action_definitions: Vec<ActionDefinition>,
    condition_definitions: Vec<ConditionDefinition>,
    spawn_definitions: Vec<SpawnDefinition>,
    status_effect_definitions: Vec<StatusEffectDefinition>,
) -> GameResult<GameState>
```

The API includes:

- ✅ Definition validation to ensure all referenced IDs exist
- ✅ Character behavior reference validation
- ✅ Basic circular reference detection for spawn definitions
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with new GameError variants

## Data Models

### ID Management

All definition IDs will be managed as indices into their respective Vec collections:

- ActionId: usize (index into action_definitions)
- ConditionId: usize (index into condition_definitions)
- SpawnLookupId: usize (index into spawn_definitions) - already exists
- StatusEffectId: usize (index into status_effect_definitions)

### Instance Management

Active instances will be tracked separately from definitions:

- ActionInstance: Runtime state for active actions
- ConditionInstance: Runtime state for condition evaluations
- StatusEffectInstance: Runtime state for active status effects (already exists)

### Reference Resolution

✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - The GameState provides definition lookup methods:

```rust
impl GameState {
    pub fn get_action_definition(&self, id: ActionId) -> Option<&ActionDefinition> {
        self.action_definitions.get(id)
    }

    pub fn get_condition_definition(&self, id: ConditionId) -> Option<&ConditionDefinition> {
        self.condition_definitions.get(id)
    }

    pub fn get_status_effect_definition(&self, id: StatusEffectId) -> Option<&StatusEffectDefinition> {
        self.status_effect_definitions.get(id)
    }

    pub fn get_spawn_definition(&self, id: usize) -> Option<&SpawnDefinition> {
        self.spawn_definitions.get(id)
    }

    // Similar methods for instances and mutable access
}
```

## Error Handling

### Definition Validation

During game initialization, the system will validate that all referenced IDs exist:

- Character behaviors reference valid ConditionId and ActionId pairs
- Action spawns reference valid SpawnLookupId values
- Circular references are detected and reported

### Runtime Error Handling

During gameplay, missing definition lookups will be handled gracefully:

- Invalid IDs will log warnings and skip execution
- Fallback behaviors will prevent game crashes
- Error states will be tracked for debugging

### Error Types

✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - New error variants have been added to GameError:

```rust
pub enum GameError {
    // Existing variants...
    InvalidActionId,           // ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    InvalidConditionId,        // ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    InvalidStatusEffectId,     // ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    InvalidSpawnId,           // ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    CircularReference,        // ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    MissingDefinition,        // ✅ IMPLEMENTED
}
```

These errors are integrated into the error handling system with appropriate error messages and recoverability flags.
