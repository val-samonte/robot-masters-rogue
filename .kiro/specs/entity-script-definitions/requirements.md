# Requirements Document

## Introduction

~~The current game engine embeds scripts directly into Characters and Spawns, leading to redundant data storage and bloated game state.~~ This feature ~~will~~ **has** refactor**ed** the system to use definition-based references, where Actions, Conditions, Spawns, and StatusEffects are defined once and referenced by ID, significantly reducing memory usage and improving maintainability.

## Implementation Status

**✅ COMPLETED** - All requirements have been successfully implemented. The game engine now uses a definition-based architecture with ID references, eliminating redundant data storage and providing efficient memory usage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want to define Actions, Conditions, Spawns, and StatusEffects once and reference them by ID, so that I can reduce memory usage and eliminate redundant data in the game state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN the game engine initializes THEN the system SHALL accept definitions for Actions, Conditions, Spawns, and StatusEffects as separate collections
2. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN multiple characters use the same Action THEN the system SHALL store only one definition and reference it by ID
3. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN the game state is serialized THEN the system SHALL include definition collections at the top level
4. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - IF a definition is referenced by ID THEN the system SHALL be able to retrieve the complete definition from the collections

### Requirement 2 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want Characters to store behavior as pairs of Condition+Action IDs, so that I can reference shared definitions instead of duplicating script data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN a Character is created THEN the system SHALL store behaviors as a Vec of (Condition ID, Action ID) pairs
2. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN a Character executes a behavior THEN the system SHALL resolve the IDs to their corresponding definitions
3. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN multiple Characters share the same behavior THEN the system SHALL reference the same definition IDs
4. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - IF a behavior ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully

### Requirement 3 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want Spawn actions to reference shared projectile definitions by ID, so that identical projectiles don't create duplicate definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN a Shoot action creates a projectile THEN the system SHALL reference a Spawn definition by ID
2. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN multiple Actions spawn the same projectile type THEN the system SHALL reference the same Spawn definition ID
3. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN a Spawn is instantiated THEN the system SHALL create an instance from the definition while maintaining the reference
4. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - IF a Spawn definition ID is not found THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error

### Requirement 4 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the public API to accept definition collections, so that I can initialize the game engine with all necessary definitions upfront.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN initializing the game engine THEN the API SHALL accept collections of Action definitions
2. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN initializing the game engine THEN the API SHALL accept collections of Condition definitions
3. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN initializing the game engine THEN the API SHALL accept collections of Spawn definitions
4. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN initializing the game engine THEN the API SHALL accept collections of StatusEffect definitions
5. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN definitions are provided THEN the system SHALL validate that all referenced IDs exist
6. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - IF circular references exist in definitions THEN the system SHALL detect and report the error

### Requirement 5 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want definition instances to be managed at the game state level, so that I can track active instances separately from their definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN the game state is created THEN the system SHALL maintain definition collections at the top level
2. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN definitions are instantiated THEN the system SHALL create instances that reference their definition IDs
3. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN instances are modified during gameplay THEN the system SHALL preserve the original definitions
4. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN the game state is saved THEN the system SHALL include both definitions and active instances

### Requirement 6 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the status effects system to work with the new ID-based architecture, so that status effects can be managed efficiently without duplicating definition data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN status effects are applied to characters THEN the system SHALL store StatusEffectInstanceId references instead of full objects
2. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN status effects are processed THEN the system SHALL resolve IDs to definitions and instances at runtime
3. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - WHEN status effects stack or expire THEN the system SHALL manage instance state while preserving definition data
4. ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - IF status effect IDs are invalid THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
