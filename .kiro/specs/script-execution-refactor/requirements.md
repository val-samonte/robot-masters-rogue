# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current script execution system for status effects has fundamental architectural issues that prevent proper script execution due to borrow checker conflicts. The system needs to be refactored to enable script execution while maintaining Rust's memory safety guarantees without resorting to unsafe code or architectural shortcuts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want status effect scripts (on_script, tick_script, off_script) to execute properly, so that status effects can have dynamic behavior and game logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a status effect is applied to a character THEN the on_script SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN a status effect is being processed each frame THEN the tick_script SHALL execute successfully
3. WHEN a status effect is removed from a character THEN the off_script SHALL execute successfully
4. WHEN script execution occurs THEN it SHALL NOT use unsafe code or architectural workarounds
5. WHEN script execution occurs THEN it SHALL maintain Rust's memory safety guarantees

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a unified script execution system, so that I don't have duplicate code and can maintain consistency across different script types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing different script types THEN the system SHALL use a single, well-designed execution function
2. WHEN adding new script types THEN the system SHALL NOT require duplicating execution logic
3. WHEN script execution occurs THEN it SHALL properly leverage the existing ScriptEngine and ScriptContext abstractions
4. WHEN script execution occurs THEN it SHALL follow established patterns in the codebase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the script execution system to properly separate concerns, so that game state management and script execution don't create borrow checker conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN script execution occurs THEN it SHALL NOT require simultaneous mutable borrows of the same data
2. WHEN script execution occurs THEN the borrow checker conflicts SHALL be resolved through proper design
3. WHEN script execution occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between script execution context and game state management
4. WHEN script execution occurs THEN it SHALL use proper Rust ownership patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the script execution system to be extensible, so that I can add new script contexts (actions, conditions, etc.) without architectural changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new script contexts THEN the system SHALL support them without major refactoring
2. WHEN different contexts need script execution THEN they SHALL use the same underlying execution mechanism
3. WHEN script execution occurs THEN the context-specific data access SHALL be properly abstracted
4. WHEN script execution occurs THEN it SHALL work with any type implementing ScriptContext

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the script execution system to maintain performance, so that script execution doesn't become a bottleneck in the game loop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scripts execute THEN the system SHALL NOT introduce unnecessary allocations or cloning
2. WHEN scripts execute THEN the system SHALL minimize the overhead of context switching
3. WHEN scripts execute THEN the system SHALL reuse ScriptEngine instances where possible
4. WHEN scripts execute THEN the performance SHALL be comparable to or better than the original disabled implementation
