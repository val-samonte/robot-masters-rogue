# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the code quality, maintainability, and performance of the Robot Masters Game Engine. Based on clippy analysis and code review, there are several areas where the codebase can be optimized and cleaned up without changing core functionality. These improvements will make the code more idiomatic, performant, and maintainable while following Rust best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the game engine, I want the code to follow Rust best practices and idioms, so that it's easier to understand, maintain, and contribute to.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clippy is run on the codebase THEN there SHALL be zero warnings
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all standard Rust traits SHALL be implemented where appropriate
3. WHEN examining macro definitions THEN they SHALL use proper hygiene with `$crate` references
4. WHEN looking at method signatures THEN they SHALL use the most appropriate parameter types (slices vs Vec)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the math system, I want standard arithmetic operators to work with Fixed and Vec2 types, so that I can write more intuitive mathematical expressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Fixed types THEN standard operators (+, -, \*, /, -) SHALL be available through traits
2. WHEN using Vec2 types THEN standard addition operator SHALL be available through traits
3. WHEN creating TrigTables THEN Default trait SHALL be available for initialization
4. WHEN performing arithmetic operations THEN the behavior SHALL remain identical to current implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer optimizing performance, I want loops and iterations to use the most efficient patterns, so that the game engine runs with optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN iterating over collections THEN iterator patterns SHALL be used instead of manual indexing where appropriate
2. WHEN enumerating collections THEN unused indices SHALL be eliminated
3. WHEN using match expressions THEN they SHALL use `matches!` macro where appropriate
4. WHEN processing character strings THEN single characters SHALL use `push()` instead of `push_str()`

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer reading the code, I want unnecessary complexity to be removed, so that the code is as clear and concise as possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining conditional logic THEN collapsible `else if` blocks SHALL be simplified
2. WHEN looking at lifetime annotations THEN unnecessary explicit lifetimes SHALL be removed
3. WHEN reviewing closures THEN redundant closures SHALL be replaced with direct function references
4. WHEN checking function parameters THEN they SHALL use the most restrictive appropriate type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code reliability, I want all compiler and clippy warnings to be resolved, so that the codebase maintains high quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `cargo clippy` THEN there SHALL be zero warnings
2. WHEN running `cargo check` THEN there SHALL be zero warnings
3. WHEN building the project THEN there SHALL be zero compiler warnings
4. WHEN applying fixes THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged
