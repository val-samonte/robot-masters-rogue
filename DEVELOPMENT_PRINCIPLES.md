# Development Principles

## Core Principles for This Project

### 1. NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

- **NEVER maintain backward compatibility** when implementing new features
- This is a fresh start project with no legacy code to support
- Always implement the cleanest, most direct solution
- Remove old code paths when implementing new ones
- Focus on the best design, not compatibility with old systems

### 2. Clean Implementation

- Write minimal, focused code that solves the specific problem
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or compatibility layers
- Remove unused code immediately
- Prioritize clarity and simplicity over flexibility

### 3. Fresh Start Mindset

- We are building from scratch
- No production systems to maintain
- No existing users to support during transitions
- Take advantage of this freedom to build the best possible system

## Remember

This project is in active development. We can break things, change APIs, and redesign systems freely. Use this freedom to build something great, not to maintain something old.
